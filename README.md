# AI for S.E.A Challenge Submission
Author: Shahbakht Hamdani

This repository is made to submit the AI or S.E.A challenge notebook. 

## Instructions to run the notebook

- Please run the complete notebook. 
- Will have to put the training file in this repo manually after cloning this repo. I am unable to do so due to size limitation.
- Sections 1-5 are my working towards a solution. They include EDA, data preparation, analysis on training data, etc.
- Section 6 deals with handling external/held-out dataset. It has self-contained code that uses previous training data and 14 days from test data to run, and conduct forecast for 5 time intervals at 15 min apart.

## Resources

I utilised following resources for my implementation:

- Kaggle Repo by Mahadir Ahmad [https://www.kaggle.com/mahadir/grab-traffic-demand-forecasting]
- Time series forecasting tutorial [https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/tutorial-time-series-forecasting-with-prophet]
